#  Guts

This folder contains the dirty inner-workings of SHELF.

You should never need to develop with these files, so they're all `internal`/`package` scoped.

When developing with SHELF, you should be able to use the `public` APIs in the top-level source folder.

If you find those public APIs lacking and need something from this Guts folder, please file an issue on the SHELF GitHub (or contact Ky directly) to request that functionality.

Or fork this and do whatever. Go ham, I'm a README not a cop.
